# Cryptr with Laravel API

## 01 - Configuration

🛠️️ To create your laravel application, type this command:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel cryptr-laravel-api-sample
```

This creates a new folder called `cryptr-laravel-api-sample` and configures your application in that folder

Note: __Composer is a dependency manager in PHP. With it, you can declare the dependent libraries your project needs and they will be installed in your project by this tool. See Composer's getting started doc for more information.__

🛠️️ Once it’s finished, go to your project

```bash
cd cryptr-laravel-api-sample
```

You can start the application by running `php artisan serve`
